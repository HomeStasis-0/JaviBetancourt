            <h2>Prompt</h2>
            <p>Could you make a website using HTML, CSS, that will include the following about me: "My name is Javier Betancourt, a Computer Science student at Texas A&M University, graduating in May 2026"? Add something showcasing AI's power, such as an animation or something like that. Add the languages that I am familiar with in a section too: those are Python, C++, C, HTML, CSS. Could you also have a section as a block showing this prompt? And on the top left, have a home button going back to index.html.</p>
