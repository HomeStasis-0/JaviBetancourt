            Hey! My name is Javier 'Javi', I am an Honors Computer Science student at Texas A&M University, with a minor in Mathematics and Game Design and Development. I am passionate about Computer-Human Interaction and Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on the intersection of the two. I am also the tech lead of the Texas A&#38;M Cyber Security Club, where I maintain the website and backend of the overall club functions.
               <br> 
               <br>  
               During my time at A&#38;M I have also been privileged to work as an undergraduate teaching assistant for CSCE 120, which has allowed me to gain invaluable leadership skills by allowing me to teach fellow students in weekly labs, while also aiding them during office hours to increase their understanding of Computer Science concepts such as memory management, debugging, and basic data structures.
